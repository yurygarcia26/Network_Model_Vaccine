# Vaccination Scenarios for Costa Rica Using a Network Model
Codes to simulate the scenarios presented in the article:  "Projecting the Impact of Covid-19 Variants and Vaccination Strategies in Disease Transmission using a Network Model in Costa Rica"

Each folder correspond to one of the scenarios and the file that have to be run is main.mat.
20 simulations could take around 48 houres.

Scenario_1 = The dominant variants up to July 2021 remain dominant for the remainder of the year. A low vaccination rate of 13,000
             daily doses is considered with a low acceptance by the population.


Scenario_2 = The dominant variants up to July 2021 remain dominant for the remainder of the year. A high vaccination rate of 30,000 
             daily doses is considered with a hig acceptance by the population.
               
Scenario_Delta1 = Delta variant become gradually dominant. A low vaccination rate of 13,000
                  daily doses is considered with a low acceptance by the population.
                    
Scenario_Delta2 = Delta variant become gradually dominant. A high vaccination rate of 30,000 
                  daily doses is considered with a hig acceptance by the population.
